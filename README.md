!!!MAKE SURE THE DIRECTORY CONTAINING THE "PvZ" and "Sprites" DIRECTORIES IS NAMED "ProjectPvZ" AS THE GAME REQUIRES THAT IN ORDER TO FUNCTION!!!

Dependancies:
1) python (tested on 3.11)
2) pygame

How To Run:
in the directory PvZ, run "game.py" for the client application and "server.py" for the server.
